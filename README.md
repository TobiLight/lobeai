# Conversing with an E-commerce Store Database

## Summary

Transform how businesses interact with data by building a system where non-tech savvy users can query an e-commerce database using simple, everyday language. This challenge is all about bridging the gap between complex data management and intuitive user experience.

## Requirements

1. **Implement an AI agent to convert natural language queries into SQL.**
   - Develop an intelligent system that understands and translates natural language queries into SQL commands for efficient interaction with the e-commerce database.

2. **Design a user-friendly chat interface.**
   - Create an intuitive and user-friendly chat interface that allows users to interact seamlessly with the AI agent. Consider ease of use and accessibility for a wide range of users.

3. **Provide a demo e-commerce database.**
   - Set up a demonstration e-commerce database that showcases the functionality of the system. Populate the database with sample data representative of an e-commerce store.

4. **Include a tutorial or help feature for new users to learn the system.**
   - Develop a tutorial or help feature within the system to guide new users on how to use the chat interface, formulate queries, and interpret results.

## Submission Guidelines

- **Figma (Optional):** Provide a link to your Figma design/prototype for your project.
- **GitHub Repository:** Share the link to your GitHub repository containing all the relevant source code and project files.
- **Deployed Link:** Host your project on platforms like Netlify or Heroku. If it's a mobile app, provide a public link to the APK on Google Drive.
